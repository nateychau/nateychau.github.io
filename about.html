        My name is Nathan, and I’m an aspiring UI/UX designer. I’m a former Learning Applications Developer Intern at BD, Web Designer at Notch, and UCSD graduate with a B.S. in Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Human Computer Interaction. I’m a San Francisco native, and I love to rock climb and try out local eateries in my free time!

My passion for design lies at the intersection between art and technology. I’ve loved drawing and painting since I was a child. Art has always been a way for me to express my thoughts and struggles, and it became a real channel for self-growth during college. Technology has also surrounded me since I was young (for better or for worse). I spent many hours throughout my childhood and adolescence on the internet, and my father taught me how to code when I first began high school. During my second year at UCSD, I decided to pursue Human Computer Interaction (now called Design and Interaction), because I felt like it captured a balance between my passion for art and my experience with technology. For more about my skills and experience, check out my resume here.

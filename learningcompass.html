        <h3>Becton Dickinson - San Diego, CA | July 2019 - September 2019</h3>
        <p>In collaboration with: Sangeetha Ganessan, BD Education Services Team</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            From the beginning of July 2019 to the end of September, 
            I interned at BD (Becton Dickinson) as a Learning Applications Developer. 
            I was a member of their Education Services Team in San Diego, 
            and my work mainly involved improving the user experience of BD Learning Compass,
             the company’s customer-facing learning management system (LMS). 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>BD Learning Compass Tutorial:</b>  Many of our LMS’s first-time users were struggling 
            to navigate around the site, and to find the courses that they needed to take. 
            With team members, I conducted usability tests to understand user needs, 
            and to find the issues that users were struggling with. 
            To address the pain-points that we found, I designed and developed a tutorial overlay application
            that would appear on the site when a user logged in for the first time. The overlay was created
            in HTML/Javascript/CSS. The LMS was hosted on a closed source platform, which made it difficult for us to
            add custom code. I found a way around this by loading my JS through a Google Tag Manager feature that 
            was built into the LMS platform. Groundbreaking stuff. 
        </p>

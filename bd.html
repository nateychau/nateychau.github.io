        <h3>Learning Applications Developer Intern</h3>
        <h4>San Diego, CA | July 2019 - September 2019</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          From the beginning of July 2019 to the end of September, I interned at BD (Becton Dickinson) as a Learning Applications Developer. 
          BD is a medical technology company that focuses on medical devices and solutions. I was a member of their Education Services Team in San Diego, and my work mainly involved improving the user experience of BD Learning Compass, 
          the company’s customer-facing learning management system (LMS). I worked closely with the team’s UI/UX designer, as well as our eLearning Designers and LMS admins, to create solutions that met customer needs. 
          During my time there, my focus has been on three main projects:
        </p>
          <br>
          <h4>BD Learning Compass Tutorial:</h4>  
          <p>
            Many of our LMS’s first-time users were struggling to navigate around the site, and to find the courses that they needed to take. With team members, I conducted usability tests to understand user needs, 
            and to find the issues that users were struggling with. To address the pain-points that we found, I designed and developed a tutorial overlay that would appear on the site when a user logged in for the first time. 
          </p>
          <h4>BD Learning Compass Course Thumbnails:</h4>
          <p>
            A good number of course thumbnails were out-dated, and users reported having difficulty reading them, or not finding them useful at all. 
            To address this, I helped design a new thumbnail template that aimed to improve text readability, and convey information quickly and clearly. 
            The new thumbnails feature a color-coded banner that indicates the intended audience, and keywords to help users identify what the course involves. 
          </p>
          <h4>SharePoint Education Catalog:</h4> 
          <p>
            This project was an effort to consolidate all of our internal training into one catalog, so that company associates could easily find curriculum that they needed to complete.
             My role on the project was to develop the site on SharePoint to host links to all of our training - one that was user-friendly and easy to navigate.
          </p>

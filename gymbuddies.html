    <h3>UCSD - La Jolla, CA | April 2019 - June 2019</h3>
    <p>In collaboration with: Rubaiat Tazim, Anmol Arora, Denise Yun Tang, and Brandon Kim

      Gym Buddies is a program that pairs mentors with mentees at UCSD gyms.
      This human-centered design project was created as part of a UCSD course, and it aims to
      address the problem of novices struggling to start, and continue, going to the gym consistently.
      Interviews with both experienced gym-goers and gym novices revealed that many who turned it into a habit had
      some sort of experienced mentor that introduced them to working out. Through a process of field observations,
      user interviews and need finding, and design exercises (such as affinity diagrams and user personas), our team 
      created the Gym Buddies program. Participants sign up as either a mentor or mentee, and get paired to their own
      mentor/mentee based on scheduling and other preferences. Both parties receive a stamp card, which they can fill
      out as they visit the gym together. Stamps are exchanged for rewards such as UCSD merchandise or fitness class credits.
